## Overview
DataWhisk is a powerful tool designed to scrape Google Reviews using Playwright, perform sentiment analysis using a transformer-based model, and extract insights from customer feedback. 
The project leverages **Playwright (Node.js)** for web scraping and **Python (Scikit-Learn, Transformers, Matplotlib, WordCloud)** for data processing and visualization.

## Features
- **Automated Web Scraping**: Uses Playwright to extract reviews from Google.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Applies a transformer-based model to evaluate review sentiment.
- **Aspect-Based Insights**: Categorizes reviews into aspects such as food, service, atmosphere, and pricing.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies common terms in negative reviews for actionable improvements.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates word clouds and aggregates aspect ratings.

## Technologies Used
- **Playwright (Node.js)**: Web scraping automation
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `transformers`: BERT-based sentiment analysis
  - `scikit-learn`: Keyword extraction
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` & `wordcloud`: Data visualization

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/abaan-noman/datawhisk.git
   cd datawhisk
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   - **For Node.js (Playwright)**:
     ```
     npm install playwright
     ```
   - **For Python (Data Analysis & Sentiment)**:
     ```
     pip install transformers torch pandas scikit-learn matplotlib wordcloud
     ```

## Usage
### 1. Scrape Reviews
Run the Playwright script to extract Google Reviews:
```
node scrape.js
```
This will save reviews in the `googreviews` folder as JSON files.

### 2. Analyze Reviews
Run the Python script to process and analyze the reviews:
```
python bert.py
```
This will generate:
- **Sentiment-based aspect ratings**
- **Word cloud visualization**
- **Improvement suggestions based on negative reviews**

## Output Files
- `reviews_with_aspects.json`: Reviews with sentiment-based aspect ratings.
- `aspect_rating_summary.json`: Average ratings for each aspect.
- `improvement_suggestions.json`: Keywords and improvement insights.
