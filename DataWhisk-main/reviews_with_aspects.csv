Sam Jaroudi,"I've been to that bakery for almost 30 years and they are exceptional.  The mana'eesh (Lebanese pies) taste authentic and very delicious, plus their dough is light and doesn't dry up like that of other bakeries.  The cheese and zaatar pies are exquisite, but I noticed that their meat pies and very popular.

The great thing about those pies is that they taste fresh even after you freeze them, and they're handy for whenever you don't feel like cooking or ordering a heavy meal.

Aladdin is the best Lebanese pie in Ottawa.  They mastered the art of making  mana'eesh and their service is excellent ... very friendly staff and they're super fast in fulfilling orders despite long lineups.

Vegetarian options: Aside from the meat pies or those including sausages, everything else on the menu is vegetarian.

Parking: This strip mall is often busy and parking is limited, but because patient, if you wait a few minutes someone will pull out at some point.

Kid-friendliness: Kids love Lebanese pies, and there's a wise selection of bottled juices and drinks to choose from that go well with it.

David Pham,"A simple yet delicious Middle Eastern meat pie that won't break the bank.

Ordered a meat pie with cheese for $4.25, cash only. They make it fresh on the spot, so it's super hot and delicious when you receive it. Meat is wonderfully seasoned, it's oily, and it's awesome.

Simply put, it's a great local business in the area and I'd highly recommend coming here.

Mory Hakimi,"Aladdin Bakery, located at 1020 St. Laurent Blvd, Ottawa, ON K1K 4S2, is a hidden gem for lovers of authentic Lebanese and Arabic cuisine. This charming establishment offers both a restaurant and bakery experience, where you can indulge in a variety of freshly made Middle Eastern specialties.

One of the bakery's standout offerings is its traditional manakish, also known as manaeesh. These flavorful flatbreads come in a variety of toppings, including za'atar (a fragrant mix of thyme, sesame seeds, and sumac), spiced meats, and more. Whether you're craving something savory or simple, the manakish options are sure to delight your palate.

In addition to manakish, Aladdin Bakery produces a wide range of fresh bread and other baked goods daily. The quality and freshness of their products are evident with every bite, and the aroma of freshly baked bread fills the air, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.

What makes Aladdin Bakery even more appealing is its affordability. Despite the high quality of the food, the prices remain reasonable, making it a great option for anyone looking to enjoy traditional Lebanese flavors without breaking the bank.

Whether you're stopping in for a quick bite, picking up some freshly baked bread, or enjoying a full meal, Aladdin Bakery offers an authentic, satisfying, and budget-friendly taste of Lebanon in the heart of Ottawa.

Taleen D,"We were craving menekeesh and found this place through reviews. It is a small space with not much seating, but extremely busy with most people taking it to go. Service is fast and efficient, and as others have said, cash only. We sat down to enjoy the food fresh. The dough is fluffy and delicious, but also very filling so pace yourself! We tried the zaatar, cheese & meat, and feta & green olive. All were really delicious! We took more to go afterwards and enjoyed them the next day. Will definitely be back.

So I left, and next door, noticed a large line-up so I thought I would give it a try.  Wow. Great price, just baked, steaming meat pies were AMAZING.  Tried the half-meat, half cheese was great.

Mazloom Chetinkaya,"Got food poisoning for the 3rd time because of the meat pie. Uncooked and soft ""tartar"" like. The reason why I say 3rd time is because I kept giving them the benefit of the doubt, oh it's the tomatoes oh it's something else oh it's just me. But nope, it is the meat pie. I can eat anywhere, anything including their own potatoe pie, spinach pies, spinach and cheese, cheese pies everything else is ok. But the meat pie needs to be reviewed.

They put the oven at a high temperature so the crust cooks quickly without giving time for the meat to cook. It makes sense because the meat is nicely mixed with tomatoes and onions so is just more liquid so needs a bit more time than the crust to actually cook. Perhaps I'm wrong and it's well cooked but just bad quality of meat?

Regardless, will not go again because honestly being folded in 2 for 5 hours for the 3rd time doesn't feel good at all.

Justin Trudeau,"I will say I’ve had many bad experiences at this place and i definitely do not recommend going. To start id like to point out that i have been going to this spot for about 10 years but recently I've been getting so disappointed that I dont think I’ll ever go back. It all started back when i walked in during Christmas time and the gentleman behind the counter decided it was appropriate to cuss out the sacred holiday. I understand if you dont celebrate Christmas because you practice islam but you should have more respect to other people’s beliefs.   Just like you expect the respect back. Also, the quality of the pies have declined drastically and it seems they have started cheaping out because the prices have gone up but the amount of meat or cheese you get on the pies have decreased. So it makes no sense why it would even be more expensive if you’re putting less meat/cheese.

Last couple of times I've been here they have been really cheaping out on the cheese and the taste is just not the same. The cheese manoushe is turning into a pc of bread barley with cheese mostly mozzarella... that and the fact that they bake the mana2eesh ahead of time is making this place less desirable for me at least.

What we are discussing here is the pies he servers, Spinach, cheese, zaatar, manakeesh, the pizza. I stop by here in the morning, and my eyes are always bigger than my stomach. Fresh baked bread with toppings that are ordinary, combined in harmony they make together one of the best pies in town! The recipe is not complicated, the ingredients are not hard to find. The only thing setting them apart from all the competition in ONTARIO is their make on demand order.",5,3,3,5

If I were in the neighbourhood I wouldn't hesitate to go back to Aladdin. As for the claim of being the best cheese pie in the city, they are definitely very tasty and even a bit different with the thin dough, but I wouldn't say they are better or worse then the scrumpdidlyumptious cheese pies that are closer to my place.",4,4,3,3
