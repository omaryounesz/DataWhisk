    "review":"I've been to that bakery for almost 30 years and they are exceptional.  The mana'eesh (Lebanese pies) taste authentic and very delicious, plus their dough is light and doesn't dry up like that of other bakeries.  The cheese and zaatar pies are exquisite, but I noticed that their meat pies and very popular.\n\nThe great thing about those pies is that they taste fresh even after you freeze them, and they're handy for whenever you don't feel like cooking or ordering a heavy meal.\n\nAladdin is the best Lebanese pie in Ottawa.  They mastered the art of making  mana'eesh and their service is excellent ... very friendly staff and they're super fast in fulfilling orders despite long lineups.\n\nVegetarian options: Aside from the meat pies or those including sausages, everything else on the menu is vegetarian.\n\nParking: This strip mall is often busy and parking is limited, but because patient, if you wait a few minutes someone will pull out at some point.\n\nKid-friendliness: Kids love Lebanese pies, and there's a wise selection of bottled juices and drinks to choose from that go well with it.\nFood: 5\/5\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0Service: 5\/5\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0Atmosphere: 5\/5\n\nRecommended dishes\nMeat Pie, Sausage & Cheese, Cheese Pie, Veggie Zaatar, And Olives, And Veg, Potato & Meat Pie, Bottled Water, Cream Cheese & Olives Lebneh, Cheese & Olives, Zaatar w Lebneh\n\nParking space\nSomewhat difficult to find parking\n\nParking options\nFree parking lot",

Whether you're craving something savory or simple, the manakish options are sure to delight your palate.\n\nIn addition to manakish, Aladdin Bakery produces a wide range of fresh bread and other baked goods daily.

    "review":"Got food poisoning for the 3rd time because of the meat pie. Uncooked and soft \"tartar\" like. The reason why I say 3rd time is because I kept giving them the benefit of the doubt, oh it's the tomatoes oh it's something else oh it's just me. But nope, it is the meat pie. I can eat anywhere, anything including their own potatoe pie, spinach pies, spinach and cheese, cheese pies everything else is ok. But the meat pie needs to be reviewed.\n\nThey put the oven at a high temperature so the crust cooks quickly without giving time for the meat to cook. It makes sense because the meat is nicely mixed with tomatoes and onions so is just more liquid so needs a bit more time than the crust to actually cook. Perhaps I'm wrong and it's well cooked but just bad quality of meat?\n\nRegardless, will not go again because honestly being folded in 2 for 5 hours for the 3rd time doesn't feel good at all.\nService: 5\/5\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0Atmosphere: 3\/5\n\nRecommended dishes\nCheese Pie",

I understand if you dont celebrate Christmas because you practice islam but you should have more respect to other people\u2019s beliefs.   Just like you expect the respect back. Also, the quality of the pies have declined drastically and it seems they have started cheaping out because the prices have gone up but the amount of meat or cheese you get on the pies have decreased.
